# TetrECS - A JavaFX Grid-Based Puzzle Game

**TetrECS** is a JavaFX-based tile placement game inspired by *Tetris*. Unlike traditional Tetris, players can freely place incoming game pieces onto a fixed-size grid using keyboard controls. Strategically arrange blocks to clear lines, maximize scores, and test your planning under pressure.
